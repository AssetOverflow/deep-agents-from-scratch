Highlights:
- Rise of general purpose agents, such as Manus, Claude Code, etc.
- Common patterns involve a few context engineering techniques:
  - Isolating context to sub agents
  - Offloading context to files
  - Using a todo list tool for planning w/ recitation
  - Task specific prompt engineering

- Claude Code uses agentic search with simples tools like search, read, and edit
⏺ Search(pattern: "write_todos")

Lesson 0 - Intro  
Intro w Harrison/Lance

Lesson 1 [Slides only] - Context 
- Common patterns involve a few context engineering techniques:
  - Isolating context to sub agents
  - Offloading context to files
  - Using a todo list tool for planning w/ recitation
  - Task specific prompt engineering

Lesson 2 
- Build an agent fast with create_react_agent
- Give it built-in Tools focused on planning  
  built_in_tools = [write_todos]
- write_todos - Task planning and progress tracking
- create_react_agent and pass it the write_todos tool

Lesson 3 
- Give it built-in Tools focused on writing (write_file, read_file, ls, edit_file)
  - File system tools (write_file, read_file, ls, edit_file) - Virtual file operations on LangGraph state
  - Keep file system in state - use it to backtrack/restart
- create_react_agent and pass it the write_file, read_file, ls, edit_file tools

Lesson 4 - 
- Give it Tool focus on tasks 
- task_tool = _create_task_tool(
      list(tools) + built_in_tools,
      instructions,
      subagents or [],
      model,
      state_schema
  )
- Sub-agent spawning for context quarantine
- Task delegation to specialized agents
- Access to a default "general-purpose" subagent plus any custom subagents
- Create sub-agent and run it in isolation 

Lesson 5 - 
- Custom tool (search)
- Pass search, sub-agent, todo, and writing tools to create_react_agent
