0/ Lesson 0 - intro w Harrison/Lance
1/ lesson 1 - [Slides only] overview on the common patterns of 
   a. context isolation to sub agents, 
   b. context offloading, 
   c. todo list tool, 
   d. task specific prompt eng. 
      Context eng slides have many good citations for all. Plus the blog post. Should be quick.

   lesson 2 - build an agent fast with create_react_agent. Demo LangSmith, Studio in simple environment.

2/ lesson 3 - todo tool / planning. Easy.

3/ lesson 4 - filesystem tool. Btw this is p cool and novel. It’s smtg we chatted abt. Mock filesystem in Langgraph state is nice shortcut.

4/ lesson 5 - subagent delegation. Also a bit novel how it does it; let’s supervisor define the subagent on the fly (tools, name, prompt). whereas for DR we carefully define subagent tools / system prompt, and only let supervisor define the research topic for each. This is more flexible, am curious on performance.

5/ lesson 6 - prompting + applying to task (like DR).  But ofc general is the story here.
Btw another little tip I’ve started doing is using a think_tool. Extremely useful. Claude interleaves thinking w/ tool calls. Can see it’s though process and understand failures. Super helpful.
